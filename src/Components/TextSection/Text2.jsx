          ” I’ve journeyed for a few years but it was amazing to be able to get
          to the other 5 levels of the upper world. It was also very powerful to
          learn about the wirracocha and to feel the energy it could bring.
          Truly amazing. But to top it off it was great to speak with Alberto on
          the video calls and for him to answer questions I had was amazing it’s
          not very often you get to speak with a man that has a vast knowledge
          of shamanism and whom you have his books also. This course has taught
          me so much in so little time . Thank you Alberto and the team for
          sharing your knowledge with us.”

          “It feels all so familiar to me as if somehow I already ‘know’ what
          you are teaching. When I look back over my life, I can actually see
          and appreciate the gifts I have been given or brought with me – it
          provided a real epiphany to be truthful about the who and how of me
          and not in an individual capacity so much as in a community capacity.
          This sounds so vain and it is not – I can see why people feel so safe
          with me and loved at a really deep level. I needed to understand and
          appreciate this about myself so thank you because this course in
          particular has created that opportunity.”

          you gave us in my practice and as for myself, my life is transforming
          day by day, as my understanding for the teaching grows and I can
          embody it more and more. What I especially notice with myself is that
          my urge to be “in the right” or to know how something works, seems to
